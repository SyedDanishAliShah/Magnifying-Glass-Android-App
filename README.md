# Magnifying-Glass-Android-App
Developed an Android magnifying glass app with advanced camera and image processing features. Implemented zooming via seek bar and pinch gestures, camera freeze/unfreeze functionality, and image capture from both front and back cameras, saving images to the device gallery. Integrated five color effects and adjustable brightness for both preview and captured images. Included a settings screen for toggling camera sound and differentiated photo and video modes, restricting image capture in video mode. Conducted comprehensive testing to ensure compatibility and performance across various devices.
